# NetbankAnalyzer
This is a small project to take the csv file from Nordeas home banking solution (netbank) and parse it into something readable.

The different expenses are sorted by category, where the categories are custom. This lets you follow your expenses month by month and see e.g. 
how much money you spent on gas, restaurant visits ect and makes sure that you stay within your budget

As noted this for now only works with the file from Nordea, but can easily be extendend to work with other formats.
It works by parsing the csv file "poster.csv" to a readable spreadsheet

For now this is totally "raw" and just works for my use case. I hope to prettify this in the future as i see tons of potential for this.
